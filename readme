apollopro
An unofficial and untested simple nodejs service to read out Apollo Pro Indoor Rower. Use at your own risk!

Prerequisites
Install nodejs and npm on your machine.
Have a local or remote InfluxDB running.
Init a database on your InfluxDB
Optional
Have a local or remote Grafana account to visualize your data.

Info
The serial port is set to 9600-N-1. This app reads the 29B data stream and posts the data to an InfluxDB. Make sure you provide a URL of your InfluxDB and the name your your database.

Communication
Without really diving into it I found out that in Windows the port is initially congifured at 1200-n-1 7 bits word. Then the windows app sets it to 9600-N-1 and the communication starts. However, when in Linux and probably Mac the device pops up as ttyUSB and you can directly set it to 9600-N-1. Downlink commands end with\n while uplink responses end with \r\n

Detected commands
While sniffing the com port in Windows I found out that the application sends the following commands which I didn't really bother to investigate.

Command	Description
C\n	?
T\n	?
V\n	Possibly Version command
L\n	?
H\n	?
R\n	Read command (Used for polling the rower)
Data
The rower starts spawning data in the following format.

Byte	Description
00-02	? (fixed to 0xA 0x8 0x0)
03-04	Total Minutes
05-06	Total Seconds
07-11	Total Distance
12	?
13-14	Minutes to 500m
15-16	Seconds to 500m
17-19	SPM
20-22	Watt
23-26	Cal/h
27-28	Level
29	\n
HowTo
Clone this repository
Change to its root directory
Run npm install to install required node modules
Run npm start to start the service
Connect your rower
Enjoy fancy grafs with Grafana or any visualization platform of your choise.

To do
The plan is to wrap this up to an electron app for storing and viewing data localy. If you feel like contributing please check https://github.com/dmamalis/apollopro_desktop
